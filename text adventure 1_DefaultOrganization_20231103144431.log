We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

This is a basic implementation of the text adventure game. The main.py file sets up the GUI using tkinter and starts the game when the "Start Game" button is clicked. The game.py file contains the Game class which handles the game logic. The start() method prompts the player for their name and the bank vault code, and then calls the rob_bank() method to start the bank robbery. The rob_bank() method is where the game logic for the bank robbery should be implemented. Finally, the end_game() method displays a game over message.

Here is a new customer's task: 10 minute text adventure about robbing a bank.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the game logic for the bank robbery. Currently, the `rob_bank()` method is empty and does not provide any options or actions for the player to choose from. To fix this, you need to implement the game logic inside the `rob_bank()` method, allowing the player to make choices and progress through the bank robbery adventure.

Here's a suggestion on how to implement the game logic for the bank robbery:

```python
def rob_bank(self):
    # Perform bank robbery actions
    print("You are inside the bank. What would you like to do?")
    while True:
        action = input("Enter your action (e.g. 'look around', 'open door', 'check safe'): ")
        if action == "look around":
            print("You see a security guard, a locked door, and a safe.")
        elif action == "open door":
            print("The door is locked. You need to find a key.")
        elif action == "check safe":
            print("The safe requires a 4-digit code. You need to find the code.")
        elif action == "quit":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid action. Please try again.")
    # End the game
    self.end_game()
```

This implementation allows the player to enter different actions and receive corresponding responses. The player can explore the bank, interact with objects, and progress through the game. The loop continues until the player chooses to quit.

Please make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the game logic is implemented correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the implementation of the game logic for the bank robbery. Currently, the `rob_bank()` method is empty and does not provide any options or actions for the player to choose from. To fix this, you need to implement the game logic inside the `rob_bank()` method, allowing the player to make choices and progress through the bank robbery adventure.

Here's a suggestion on how to implement the game logic for the bank robbery:

```python
def rob_bank(self):
    # Perform bank robbery actions
    print("You are inside the bank. What would you like to do?")
    while True:
        action = input("Enter your action (e.g. 'look around', 'open door', 'check safe'): ")
        if action == "look around":
            print("You see a security guard, a locked door, and a safe.")
        elif action == "open door":
            print("The door is locked. You need to find a key.")
        elif action == "check safe":
            print("The safe requires a 4-digit code. You need to find the code.")
        elif action == "quit":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid action. Please try again.")
    # End the game
    self.end_game()
```

This implementation allows the player to enter different actions and receive corresponding responses. The player can explore the bank, interact with objects, and progress through the game. The loop continues until the player chooses to quit.

Please make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the game logic is implemented correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

What would you like to do?")\n    while True:\n        action = input("Enter your action (e.g. \'look around\', \'open door\', \'check safe\'): ")\n        if action == "look around":\n            print("You see a security guard, a locked door, and a safe.")\n        elif action == "open door":\n            print("The door is locked. You need to find a key.")\n        elif action == "check safe":\n            print("The safe requires a 4-digit code. You need to find the code.")\n        elif action == "quit":\n            break\n        else:\n            print("Invalid action. Please try again.")\n    # End the game\n    self.end_game()\n\n\nThis implementation allows the player to enter different actions and receive corresponding responses. The player can explore the bank, interact with objects, and progress through the game. The loop continues until the player chooses to quit.\n\nPlease make the necessary changes to the code and ensure that the game logic is implemented correctly.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is that the game is not interactive as it should be. Currently, the game only takes input from the command line and displays output there. To make it more interactive and user-friendly, we can modify the code to use a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the command line.

To achieve this, we can use the tkinter library to create a GUI window where the user can input actions and see the game output. We can create a text box for input and a text area for displaying the game messages. Additionally, we can add buttons for common actions such as "look around", "open door", and "check safe".

Here's an updated version of the code that implements the GUI:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from game import Game

class BankRobberyAdventure:
    def __init__(self, window):
        self.window = window
        self.window.title("Bank Robbery Adventure")

        self.game = Game()

        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        # Create a label for player name input
        name_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your name:")
        name_label.pack()

        # Create an entry field for player name input
        self.name_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)
        self.name_entry.pack()

        # Create a button to start the game
        start_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Start Game", command=self.start_game)
        start_button.pack()

        # Create a text area for displaying game messages
        self.message_text = tk.Text(self.window, height=10, width=50)
        self.message_text.pack()

        # Create a label for action input
        action_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your action:")
        action_label.pack()

        # Create an entry field for action input
        self.action_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)
        self.action_entry.pack()

        # Create a button to submit the action
        submit_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Submit", command=self.submit_action)
        submit_button.pack()

    def start_game(self):
        # Get player name from the entry field
        self.game.player_name = self.name_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Display game introduction in the message text
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, f"Welcome, {self.game.player_name}! You are about to embark on a bank robbery adventure.\n")
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, "Your mission is to successfully rob the bank vault and escape without getting caught.\n")

        # Get bank vault code from the entry field
        self.game.bank_vault_code = self.action_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Start the bank robbery
        self.game.rob_bank()

    def submit_action(self):
        # Get action from the entry field
        action = self.action_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Perform the action and display the result in the message text
        result = self.game.perform_action(action)
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, result + "\n")

        # Scroll to the bottom of the message text
        self.message_text.see(tk.END)

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()

# Create the game instance
game_app = BankRobberyAdventure(window)

# Run the main event loop
window.mainloop()
```

In this updated code, we create a new class `BankRobberyAdventure` that represents the GUI application. We create the necessary GUI elements such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and a text area. The `start_game` method is modified to get the player name and bank vault code from the entry fields. The `submit_action` method is added to handle the action input and display the result in the message text.

With these changes, the game will be more interactive and user-friendly, allowing the player to input actions and see the game messages in a graphical interface.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the game is not interactive as it should be. Currently, the game only takes input from the command line and displays output there. To make it more interactive and user-friendly, we can modify the code to use a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the command line.

To achieve this, we can use the tkinter library to create a GUI window where the user can input actions and see the game output. We can create a text box for input and a text area for displaying the game messages. Additionally, we can add buttons for common actions such as "look around", "open door", and "check safe".

Here's an updated version of the code that implements the GUI:

```python
import tkinter as tk
from game import Game

class BankRobberyAdventure:
    def __init__(self, window):
        self.window = window
        self.window.title("Bank Robbery Adventure")

        self.game = Game()

        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        # Create a label for player name input
        name_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your name:")
        name_label.pack()

        # Create an entry field for player name input
        self.name_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)
        self.name_entry.pack()

        # Create a button to start the game
        start_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Start Game", command=self.start_game)
        start_button.pack()

        # Create a text area for displaying game messages
        self.message_text = tk.Text(self.window, height=10, width=50)
        self.message_text.pack()

        # Create a label for action input
        action_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your action:")
        action_label.pack()

        # Create an entry field for action input
        self.action_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)
        self.action_entry.pack()

        # Create a button to submit the action
        submit_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Submit", command=self.submit_action)
        submit_button.pack()

    def start_game(self):
        # Get player name from the entry field
        self.game.player_name = self.name_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Display game introduction in the message text
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, f"Welcome, {self.game.player_name}! You are about to embark on a bank robbery adventure.\n")
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, "Your mission is to successfully rob the bank vault and escape without getting caught.\n")

        # Get bank vault code from the entry field
        self.game.bank_vault_code = self.action_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Start the bank robbery
        self.game.rob_bank()

    def submit_action(self):
        # Get action from the entry field
        action = self.action_entry.get()

        # Clear the entry field
        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)

        # Perform the action and display the result in the message text
        result = self.game.perform_action(action)
        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, result + "\n")

        # Scroll to the bottom of the message text
        self.message_text.see(tk.END)

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()

# Create the game instance
game_app = BankRobberyAdventure(window)

# Run the main event loop
window.mainloop()
```

In this updated code, we create a new class `BankRobberyAdventure` that represents the GUI application. We create the necessary GUI elements such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and a text area. The `start_game` method is modified to get the player name and bank vault code from the entry fields. The `submit_action` method is added to handle the action input and display the result in the message text.

With these changes, the game will be more interactive and user-friendly, allowing the player to input actions and see the game messages in a graphical interface."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Currently, the game only takes input from the command line and displays output there. To make it more interactive and user-friendly, we can modify the code to use a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the command line.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the tkinter library to create a GUI window where the user can input actions and see the game output. We can create a text box for input and a text area for displaying the game messages. Additionally, we can add buttons for common actions such as "look around", "open door", and "check safe".\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the code that implements the GUI:\n\npython\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom game import Game\n\nclass BankRobberyAdventure:\n    def __init__(self, window):\n        self.window = window\n        self.window.title("Bank Robbery Adventure")\n\n        self.game = Game()\n\n        self.create_widgets()\n\n    def create_widgets(self):\n        # Create a label for player name input\n        name_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your name:")\n        name_label.pack()\n\n        # Create an entry field for player name input\n        self.name_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)\n        self.name_entry.pack()\n\n        # Create a button to start the game\n        start_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Start Game", command=self.start_game)\n        start_button.pack()\n\n        # Create a text area for displaying game messages\n        self.message_text = tk.Text(self.window, height=10, width=50)\n        self.message_text.pack()\n\n        # Create a label for action input\n        action_label = tk.Label(self.window, text="Enter your action:")\n        action_label.pack()\n\n        # Create an entry field for action input\n        self.action_entry = tk.Entry(self.window)\n        self.action_entry.pack()\n\n        # Create a button to submit the action\n        submit_button = tk.Button(self.window, text="Submit", command=self.submit_action)\n        submit_button.pack()\n\n    def start_game(self):\n        # Get player name from the entry field\n        self.game.player_name = self.name_entry.get()\n\n        # Clear the entry field\n        self.name_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n\n        # Display game introduction in the message text\n        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, f"Welcome, {self.game.player_name}! You are about to embark on a bank robbery adventure.\\n")\n        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, "Your mission is to successfully rob the bank vault and escape without getting caught.\\n")\n\n        # Get bank vault code from the entry field\n        self.game.bank_vault_code = self.action_entry.get()\n\n        # Clear the entry field\n        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n\n        # Start the bank robbery\n        self.game.rob_bank()\n\n    def submit_action(self):\n        # Get action from the entry field\n        action = self.action_entry.get()\n\n        # Clear the entry field\n        self.action_entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n\n        # Perform the action and display the result in the message text\n        result = self.game.perform_action(action)\n        self.message_text.insert(tk.END, result + "\\n")\n\n        # Scroll to the bottom of the message text\n        self.message_text.see(tk.END)\n\n# Create the main window\nwindow = tk.Tk()\n\n# Create the game instance\ngame_app = BankRobberyAdventure(window)\n\n# Run the main event loop\nwindow.mainloop()\n\n\nIn this updated code, we create a new class BankRobberyAdventure that represents the GUI application. We create the necessary GUI elements such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and a text area. The start_game method is modified to get the player name and bank vault code from the entry fields. The submit_action method is added to handle the action input and display the result in the message text.\n\nWith these changes, the game will be more interactive and user-friendly, allowing the player to input actions and see the game messages in a graphical interface.'} |

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `game.py` file. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to use `tkinter` classes and functions.

To fix this, add the import statement for `tkinter` at the beginning of the `game.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `tkinter` module is properly imported and can be used in the `Game` class.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `tkinter` module in the `game.py` file. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to use `tkinter` classes and functions.

To fix this, add the import statement for `tkinter` at the beginning of the `game.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

This will ensure that the `tkinter` module is properly imported and can be used in the `Game` class."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the following format:
requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
```
In this case, the only dependency required for the project is the tkinter package, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) in the text adventure game. The version specified is 8.6, but you can adjust it based on the version available in your Python environment. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
